# Sprout
Flower breeding game built with Go and TypeScript/React

## Running the app
The app can currently be run locally by serving the frontend with Vite on port 5173 with 'npm run dev' command; and serving the backend on port 3000 by running the main.go file. 

Currently, this will show two colored divs when visiting the 5173 localhost. These divs take color data (hex colors) from the port 3000/flowers GET endpoint.

## Inspiration
Sprout is heavily inspired by the game [Seed](https://www.noio.nl/2007/12/seed/), by Thomas van den Berg. Seed is one of my favorite Flash games and in the past I have run a tab of Seed in the background for many hours at a time. I decided to create a Seed-inspired game with additional features as a tribute, for fun, and as a way to build my skills.
